# Cracking the Coding Interview
## Solutions Written in C

### Why would anyone do this
- Good practice
- Have not yet found a full solution in set in C, so hopefully this helps someone else too

### Notes
- Work in progress
- If the question doesn't specify it, I won't be implementing known algorithms or data structures from scratch. Whenever open source versions of data structures/algorithms are used, I give credit where it's due, and note that appropriately.
