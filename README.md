# Cracking the Coding Interview
## Solutions Written in C

### Why would anyone do this
- Good practice
- Have not yet found a full solution in set in C, so hopefully this helps someone else too

### Notes
- Work in progress, but doing it as time arises
- Currently looking for a reliable set of data structures to use. Was rolling my own for awhile, but that started turning into a separate project. And while very interesting, it was too time consuming for now.
- Ideally would like to build my own library of C structures for the future, but that's a longterm thing, so I'm open to other options until then.
- Decided to try using Zed Shaw's Debug Macros to make debugging simpler (hopefully...)
    * These are online at: http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex20.html
- Also reading through this for tips, and trying out some of the data structures
