# Cracking the Coding Interview
## Solutions Written in C

### Why would anyone do this
- Good practice
- Have not yet found a full solution in set in C, so hopefully this helps someone else too

### Notes
- Work in progress
- Rolling my own data structures for this... I explored a few other other libraries, but I'd rather spend my time writing code than reading documentation and fiddling around
