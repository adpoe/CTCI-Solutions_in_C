 * Problem 1.4:  Palindrome Permuation
 *
 * "Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.
 *  A palindrome is a word of phrase that is the same forwards and backwards.
 *  A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited
 *  to just dictionary words."
